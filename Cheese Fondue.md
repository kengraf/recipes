###  Ingredients

  *  
**1** garlic clove, halved crosswise
  *   
**1 1/2** cups dry white wine
  *   
**1** tablespoon cornstarch
  *   
**2** teaspoons kirsch (optional)
  *   
**1/2** pound Emmental cheese, coarsely grated (2 cups)
  *   
**1/2** pound Gruyère, coarsely grated (2 cups)
  *   
**What to dip:**
  * Cubes of French bread
  * Cubes of apple and pear
  * Roasted potatoes
  * Julienned raw red bell pepper
  * Blanched broccoli florets
  *   
**What to drink:**
  * Dry white wine such as dry Riesling or Sancerre
  * German lager or Saison-style ale
  * Farmhouse cider
  * Fino Sherry

###  Directions

Rub inside of a 4-quart heavy pot with cut sides of garlic, then discard
garlic. Add wine to pot and bring just to a simmer over moderate heat.

Stir together cornstarch and kirsch (if using; otherwise, use water or wine)
in a cup.

Gradually add cheese to pot and cook, stirring constantly in a zigzag pattern
(not a circular motion) to prevent cheese from balling up, until cheese is
just melted and creamy (do not let boil). Stir cornstarch mixture again and
stir into fondue. Bring fondue to a simmer and cook, stirring, until
thickened, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer to fondue pot set over a flame.
