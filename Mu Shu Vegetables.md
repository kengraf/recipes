###  Ingredients

  * **1** package mu shu pancakes (check these for fat content first)
  * a few wood ear or cloud ear mushrooms, soaked in hot water for 30 minutes and then cut into thin strips
  *  **2** cloves garlic, minced
  *  **1** large onion, cut into very thin wedges
  *  **1** small head green cabbage, finely shredded
  *  **1** small carrot, shredded
  *  **4** oz can mushrooms, drained (or equivalent fresh, sauteed in water)
  *  **3-4** green onions, cut into 2 inch pieces
  * Soy sauce or tamari to taste
  * Hosin sauce

###  Directions

Thaw pancakes.

In a large wok or skillet, saute the garlic and onions for three minutes in a
little water or vegetable broth. Add the cabbage, carrot and mushrooms and
saute until cabbage just wilts. Add the green onions, soy sauce (about 1-2
tbsp is good) and about 1 tbsp of hosin sauce. Heat through.

Place one pancake in the microwave for 10 seconds (helps to make them more
pliable). Remove and spread with a tbsp of hosin sauce, and then about 1/2 cup
of the mu shu mixture. Fold the bottom of the pancake up about 1/4 of the way,
then fold the two sides in. I sort of roll them, actually, so it is easier to
eat.

You could also add some julienne strips of tofu or any other vegetables you
like (i.e., bean sprouts, celery, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, etc.).

This was even better the second day (don't put them in the pancakes until
right before you want to eat them, howe'ver).
