###  Directions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Cut each potato in half and using a melon baller or sharp teaspoon, scoop out
the inside of the potato leaving about 1/4 inch border.

Put potatoes in a large bowl and drizzle with olive oil and season with
spices.

Place potatoes on a large sheet pan and put in the preheated oven for about 30
minutes, flipping once, until potatoes are fork tender. Let cool for a few
minutes.

In a medium sized bowl add the avocado slices and mash them.

Then add the remaining guacamole ingredients and stir until combined.

Scoop a small spoonful of guacamole mixture into each potato cup.

Garnish with radish matchsticks and cilantro leaves, if desired.
