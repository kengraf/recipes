###  Ingredients

  * **1** pound ground bison (450g)
  *  **2** onions
  *  **5** cloves garlic
  *  **2** green bell peppers
  *  **2** jalapeno peppers (de-seeded and finely chopped)
  *  **3** chipotles in adobo sauce (finely chopped)
  *  **6** ounces tomato paste (1 small can, 170g)
  *  **1** teaspoon cumin
  *  **½** teaspoon cayenne pepper
  *  **1** teaspoon smoked paprika
  *  **2** teaspoons salt
  *  **½** teaspoon black pepper
  *  **1** teaspoon sugar
  *  **1** can kidney beans (15 ounce can, rinsed and drained, about 250g rehydrated)
  *  **1** can pinto or pink beans (15 ounce can, rinsed and drained, about 250g rehydrated)
  *  **28** ounces crushed tomatoes (800g)
  *  **3** cups chicken stock (700 ml)

###  Directions

Heat a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the ground bison and let it
brown, breaking it up with a wooden spatula (you can add a couple tablespoons
of oil if there isn’t enough fat in your bison to prevent sticking). When the
bison is browned, add the onions and garlic. Saute until the onions are
translucent.

Next, add the bell peppers and jalapeno peppers. Cook for 5 minutes to let the
peppers cook. Add the chilis in adobo sauce, tomato paste, cumin, cayenne
pepper, paprika, salt, pepper, and sugar. Stir to combine. Add both cans of
beans, the crushed tomatoes, and chicken stock.

Bring to a boil, stirring to combine. Turn the heat down to low, and let the
chili simmer for an additional two hours. Before serving, add salt to taste,
and finish each bowl with a sprinkling of grated cheddar cheese, sliced
avocado, and a side of tortilla chips!
