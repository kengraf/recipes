###  Ingredients

  * **1/2** pound linguini
  *  **1** pound scallops
  * Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
  *  **1** tablespoon olive oil plus some for drizzling
  *  **3** tablespoons butter divided
  *  **4** cloves garlic chopped
  *  **1** large shallot finely chopped
  *  **1/2** teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
  *  **4** sprigs fresh thyme leaves removed and chopped
  *  **1** cup white wine Sauv Blanc
  *  **1** cup chicken stock
  *  **1** cup fresh basil torn
  *  **1/2** cup chopped chives
  *  **1** lemon zested and juiced

###  Directions

Cook the pasta to package directions. Hold off on starting the scallops until
you drop your pasta.

Remove the muscle from the scallops and pat dry with a paper towel pat. Season
the scallops heavily with salt and pepper.

Preheat a large skillet (I like a cast iron skillet for this) over medium high
heat. Add the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter. When butter melts
into oil, add scallops. Sear the scallops for 2-3 minutes on each side until
super golden brown, then remove from pan and tent loosely with foil to keep
warm.

Add an additional drizzle of olive oil to the skillet and add the garlic,
shallots, crushed red pepper flakes, thyme, salt and pepper. Reduce heat to
medium low and sauté garlic and shallots 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly.

Add wine to the pan and scrape up any pan drippings. Reduce the wine for 1
minute, then add chicken stock. Continue to cook for about 1 minute. Add the
basil, chives, lemon zest and juice and the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter
and stir the mixture until the butter has melted.

Add the cooked pasta and cook for about 30 seconds, just to combine and let
the pasta soak up the sauce. Nestle the scallops back into the skillet to
serve.
