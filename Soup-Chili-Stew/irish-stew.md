#  Irish Stout Stew

**Prep** 10 m  
**Cook** 3 h  
**Makes** 6  

###  Ingredients

  *  **1 1/2** pounds lamb, cut into 1-inch cubes
  *  **2** tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
  *  **3** tablespoons all-purpose flour
  *  **1** pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
  *  **1** cup Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®)
  *  **1 1/2** cups beef stock
  *  **1** tbsp worcestershire sauce
  *  **2** bay leaves
  *  **3** leeks, sliced and well rinsed. Trim the tough green end and discard.
  *  **2 or 3** parsnips, peeled and sliced
  *  **2** turnips, peeled and diced
  *  **2** cups chopped carrots
  *  **4** potatoes, peeled, halved, and thickly sliced
  *  **1** sprig fresh thyme
  *  **1/4** head green cabbage
  *  **1** tablespoon chopped fresh parsley for garnish

###  Directions

* Toss the meat with the flour, 1 tsp salt, and 1 tsp pepper to coat.
 add 1 Tablespoon of the oil. When the pot is hot, brown the meat on all sides, working in batches so you don’t crowd the pot. Add the rest of the oil as necessary.
Remove the lamb and set aside.
Add the Guinness to the pot and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom.
Press cancel. Add the meat back into the pan along with the stock, Worcestershire sauce, bay leaves, and veggies. Add the bundle of rosemary or thyme.
Close the lid, lock, and set the vent to the seal position. Pressure cook on high for 30 minutes. When the machine beeps, let the pressure release naturally, this may take 15 – 20 minutes.
Add the cabbage to the stew and stir well. It will wilt in the heat of the stew.
Meanwhile make a paste of the butter and flour, and when the stew is done, blend it in, stirring well, to thicken the broth slightly. Taste to adjust seasonings and serve with lots of chopped parsley. This is the most important step in the recipe ~ take the time to taste and adjust, it makes all the difference.
