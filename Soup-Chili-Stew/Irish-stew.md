#  Irish Stout Stew

**Prep** 10 m  
**Cook** 3 h  
**Makes** 6  

###  Ingredients

  *  **1 1/2** pounds lamb, cut into 1-inch cubes
  *  **2** tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
  *  **3** tablespoons all-purpose flour
  *  **1** pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
  *  **1** cup Irish stout beer (such as GuinnessÂ®)
  *  **1 1/2** cups beef stock
  *  **1** tbsp worcestershire sauce
  *  **2** bay leaves
  *  **3** leeks, sliced and well rinsed. Trim the tough green end and discard.
  *  **2 or 3** parsnips, peeled and sliced
  *  **2** turnips, peeled and diced
  *  **2** cups chopped carrots
  *  **4** potatoes, peeled, halved, and thickly sliced
  *  **1** sprig fresh thyme or rosemary
  *  **1/4** head green cabbage
  *  **1** tablespoon chopped fresh parsley for garnish

###  Directions


* Toss the lamb cubes with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil.
* In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, salt, and pepper. Dredge the lamb in this to coat.
* Heat the remaining oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the lamb, and brown on all sides.
* Remove the lamb and set aside.
* Add the Guinness to the pot and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom.
* Add the veggies: leeks, parsnips, turnips, and carrots
* Add the beef stock, Guiness, Worcestershire, bay leaves, and bundle of rosemary/thyme
* Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 5 minutes.
* Add the lamb back in.
* Simmer for 3 hours, stirring occasionally.
> [!TIP]
> This is the most important step in the recipe ~ take the time to taste and adjust, it makes all the difference.
* Add potatos with an hour left.
* Add the cabbage to the stew and stir well. It will wilt in the heat of the stew.
* Meanwhile make a paste of the butter and flour, and when the stew is done, blend it in, stirring well, to thicken the broth slightly.
* Taste to adjust seasonings and serve with lots of chopped parsley.
