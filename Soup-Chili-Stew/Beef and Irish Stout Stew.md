###  Ingredients

  *  **2** pounds lean beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch cubes
  *  **3** tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
  *  **2** tablespoons all-purpose flour
  *  **1** pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
  *  **1** pinch cayenne pepper
  *  **2** large onions, chopped
  *  **1** clove garlic, crushed
  *  **2** tablespoons tomato paste
  *  **1 1/2** cups Irish stout beer (such as GuinnessÂ®)
  *  **2** cups chopped carrot
  *  **1** sprig fresh thyme
  *  **1** tablespoon chopped fresh parsley for garnish

###  Directions

Toss the beef cubes with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. In a separate bowl,
stir together the flour, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper. Dredge the beef in
this to coat.

Heat the remaining oil in a deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
Add the beef, and brown on all sides. Add the onions, and garlic. Stir the
tomato paste into a small amount of water to dilute; pour into the pan and
stir to blend. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 5 minutes.

Pour 1/2 cup of the beer into the pan, and as it begins to boil, scrape any
bits of food from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. This adds a lot
of flavor to the broth. Pour in the rest of the beer, and add the carrots and
thyme. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 2 to 3 hours, stirring
occasionally. Taste and adjust seasoning before serving. Garnish with chopped
parsley.
