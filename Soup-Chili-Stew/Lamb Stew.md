  *  1/2 Tbsp sea salt for the lamb plus 1 tsp for stew
  *  1 tsp black pepper for lamb plus 1/2 tsp for stew
  *  1/4 cup all-purpose flour or gluten free flour*
  *  1 large yellow onion, diced
  *  4 garlic cloves, minced
  *  1 1/2 cups good red wine, 
  *  1 lb button mushrooms, thickly sliced
  *  4 cups low sodium beef broth or stock
  *  1 Tbsp tomato paste
  *  2 bay leaves
  *  1/2 tsp dried thyme
  *  1 1/2 lbs small yellow potatoes, halved or quartered into 1" pieces
  *  4 medium carrots, 10 oz, peeled and cut into 1/2" thick pieces
  *  1/4 cup parsley, finely chopped for garnish

###  Directions

In a 5Qt dutch oven, saute chopped bacon over medium heat until browned and fat released. With a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a large plate.  
While bacon cooks, season lamb pieces with 1/2 Tbsp salt and 1 tsp pepper. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup flour and toss to coat.   
Cook lamb in 2 batches in hot bacon grease over medium heat until browned (3-4 min per side) then transfer to the plate with bacon.  
Add diced onion and sauté 2 min.    
Add garlic and cook another minute, stirring constantly.   
Add 1 1/2 cups wine, scraping the bottom to deglaze.   
Add sliced mushrooms, bring to simmer then cook uncovered 10 min.  
Preheat Oven to 325˚F.  
Return bacon and lamb to pot and add 4 cups broth, 1 Tbsp tomato paste, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp dried thyme and 2 bay leaves.   
Stir in potatoes and carrots, making sure potatoes are mostly submerged in liquid.   
Bring to a boil then COVER and carefully transfer to preheated oven at 325˚F for 1 hr and 45 min. When done, potatoes and lamb will be very tender.
