###  Directions

1\. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
Season the sausage and chicken pieces with half of the Cajun seasoning.

2\. Brown sausage in the hot oil; remove with slotted spoon and set aside. Add
remaining oil to the pot and sauté chicken until lightly browned. Remove with
slotted spoon; set aside.

3\. Sauté the onion, bell pepper and celery until onion is soft and
transparent. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant (30 seconds).

4\. Stir in the tomatoes; season with salt, pepper, thyme, oregano, red pepper
flakes (or Cayenne powder), hot pepper sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and the
remaining Cajun seasoning. Stir in the okra slices (or file powder), chicken
and sausage. Cook for 5 minutes, while stirring occasionally.

5\. Add in the rice and chicken broth, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to
low-medium. Cover and let simmer for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until liquid
is absorbed and rice is cooked, while stirring occasionally.

6\. Place the shrimp on top of the Jambalaya mixture, stir through gently and
cover with lid. Allow to simmer while stirring occasionally, until the shrimp
are cooked through and pink (about 5-6 minutes, depending on the
size/thickness of the shrimp being used).

7\. Season with a little extra salt and pepper if needed and remove from heat.
Adjust heat with extra hot sauce, Cayenne pepper or Cajun seasoning. Serve
immediately with sliced green onions and parsley.
