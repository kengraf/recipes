###  Ingredients

  *  **8** bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 2 1/2 pounds)
  * Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
  *   **3** tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
  *   **1** small onion, chopped
  *   **4** cloves garlic, finely chopped
  *   **1/4** teaspoon red pepper flakes
  *   **1** tablespoon tomato paste
  *   **1/2** cup dry white wine
  *   **2** cups low-sodium chicken broth
  * One 15-ounce can cannellini bean, rinsed and drained
  * One 14-ounce can diced tomatoes
  *   **1** teaspoon dried oregano
  *   **1/3** cup grated Parmesan, plus more for serving
  * Fresh oregano for garnish (optional)

###  Directions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper.
Heat the oil in a large oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the
chicken, skin side down, and cook, until browned on both sides, about 4
minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a plate.

Reduce the heat to medium, add the onion, garlic and red pepper flakes and
cook until the onions are soft, about 7 minutes. Add the tomato paste and stir
until it coats the onions and is a shade darker, about 1 minute. Pour in the
wine and scrape up any brown bits on the bottom of the skillet. Add the broth,
beans, tomatoes and oregano and bring to a boil. Nestle the chicken in the
skillet along with any juices from the plate. Transfer the skillet to the oven
and bake until the chicken is cooked through, about 25 minutes.

Transfer the chicken thighs to a platter. Stir the cheese into the bean
mixture and season with salt and pepper and garnish with fresh oregano if
using. Serve with the chicken and extra parmesan cheese for topping.
