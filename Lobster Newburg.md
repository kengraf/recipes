###  Ingredients

  * three 1 1/2-pound live lobsters
  *  **1/2** stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter
  *  **2** tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon medium-dry Sherry
  *  **3** tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon brandy
  *  **1 1/2** cups heavy cream
  *  **1/4** teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
  * cayenne to taste
  *  **4** large egg yolks, beaten well
  * toast points as an accompaniment

###  Directions

Into a large kettle of boiling salted water plunge the lobsters, head first,
and boil them, covered, for 8 minutes from the time the water returns to a
boil. Transfer the lobsters with tongs to a cutting board and let them cool
until they can be handled. Break off the claws at the body and crack them.
Remove the claw meat and cut it into 1/2-inch pieces. Halve the lobsters
length-wise along the undersides, remove the meat from the tails, discarding
the bodies, and cut it into 1/2-inch pieces.

In a heavy saucepan cook the lobster meat in the butter over moderate heat,
stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes, add 2 tablespoons of the Sherry and 3
tablespoons of the brandy, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 2 minutes.
Transfer the lobster meat with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Add the cream to the
Sherry mixture and boil the mixture until it is reduced to about 1 cup. Reduce
the heat to low and stir in the remaining 1 teaspoon Sherry, the remaining 1
teaspoon brandy, the nutmeg, the cayenne, and salt to taste. Whisk in the
yolks, cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until it registers 140°F. on a
deep-fat thermometer, and cook it, whisking, for 3 minutes more. Stir in the
lobster meat and serve the lobster Newburg over the toast.
