- 12 ounces (1 1/2 cups) pilsner beer, such as Modelo Especial
- 1 (14-ounce) can diced or crushed tomatoes in juice
- ¼ cup cider vinegar
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup or dark brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons beef stock bouillon paste, such as Better Than Bouillon

 ### Directions
* Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium. Add the onion, season with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened and translucent, about 8 minutes. 
* Increase the heat to medium-high, add the beef and garlic, season with salt and cook, breaking the beef into crumbles with a spatula, until the beef has lost its pink color, 8 to 10 minutes. 
* Stir in the tomato paste and cook until slightly darkened and caramelized, about 1 minute. 
* Stir in all the spices and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
* Add the beer and stir, scraping the bottom of the pan.
* Transfer the beef mixture into a 5- to 8-quart slow cooker. 
* Stir in the tomatoes, vinegar, maple syrup, soy sauce, beef bouillon paste, cocoa, beans and 1/2 cup water. 
* Cover and cook on low for at least 4 hours and up to 6 hours. (The chili can hold well on warm for an additional 2 hours.)
* When ready to serve, stir in the Worcestershire sauce. If the chili is too thick, stir in a bit of water until the texture is to your liking. 
* Season to taste with salt. Serve in bowls and pass the toppings at the table.

#### Stovepot appraoch tip
You can also cook the chili in a Dutch oven on your stovetop in about 1 hour. In step 2, add 1 cup water instead of 1/2 cup and let the mixture come to a simmer over medium-high. (Because the cooking liquid reduces further on the stovetop, this method starts with more water.) Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the meat is tender, stirring occasionally, about 35 minutes.
