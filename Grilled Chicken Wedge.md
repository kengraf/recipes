###  Ingredients

  * **2** boneless skinless chicken breasts
  *  **2** tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
  * kosher salt
  * Freshly ground black pepper
  *  **1/2** c. mayonnaise
  *  **1** tbsp. red wine vinegar
  *  **2** cloves garlic, grated
  *  **1/4** c. diced red onion
  *  **2** tbsp. minced chives, plus more for garnish
  *  **1** large head iceberg lettuce, cut into 4 wedges
  *  **2** avocados, pitted and halved

###  Directions

Preheat a grill or stovetop grill pan over high heat. Rinse and dry chicken,
then drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. When grill or pan
is very hot (almost smoking), place chicken on grill. Cook until internal
temperature is 165°, 5 minutes per side. Set aside to rest for 2 to 3 minutes,
then shred using 2 forks.

Meanwhile, prepare dressing. In a medium jar add mayonnaise, olive oil, red
wine vinegar, garlic, red onion, chives, salt and pepper; shake well. Keep in
fridge until ready to serve.

Serve each iceberg wedge with half an avocado, a handful of shredded chicken
and a drizzle of salad dressing. Garnish with chives.
