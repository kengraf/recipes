###  Ingredients

  * Juice of 2 limes
  *   **1/2** c. extra-virgin olive oil, divided
  *   **1** tbsp. honey
  *   **1/2** tsp. cumin
  *   **1/4** tsp. red chili flakes
  * kosher salt
  * Freshly ground black pepper
  *   **2** boneless skinless chicken breasts
  *   **2** bell peppers, thinly sliced
  *   **1** white onion, thinly sliced
  *   **1** large head of romaine, cored and chopped
  *   **1** avocado, thinly sliced

###  Directions

In a small bowl, combine lime juice, 1/4 cup olive oil, honey, cumin and chili
flakes. Season with salt and pepper.

In a large Ziploc bag or glass baking dish, combine chicken and half the
dressing. Let marinate for at least 30 minutes and up to 6 hours.

After marinating, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a grill pan over medium-high
heat. Add chicken and grill until fully cooked through, about 6 minutes per
side. Let cool, then chop into strips.

Wipe out grill pan. Then, add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to same pan
over medium-high heat. Add peppers and onions and cook until charred and
slightly softened, 10 minutes.

In a large bowl, add romaine, chicken, peppers, onions and avocado. Toss with
remaining dressing until evenly coated.
