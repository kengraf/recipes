###  Ingredients

  *  
**1** tablespoons butter
  *   
**1/4** onion, diced
  *   
**1** ribs celery, diced
  *   
**1 1/2** cloves garlic, sliced
  *   
**1/2** pound ham, diced
  *   
**1** bay leaf
  *   
**1/2** pound dried split peas
  *   
**2** cups chicken stock
  *   
**1** cups water
  * salt and ground black pepper to taste

###  Directions

Place the butter in a large soup pot over medium-low heat. Stir in onion,
celery, and sliced garlic. Cook slowly until the onions are translucent but
not brown, 5 to 8 minutes.

Mix in ham, bay leaf, and split peas. Pour in chicken stock and water. Stir to
combine, and simmer slowly until the peas are tender and the soup is thick,
about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Stir occasionally. Season with salt and black
pepper to serve.
