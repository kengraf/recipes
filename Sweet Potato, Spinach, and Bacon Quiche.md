###  Ingredients

  *  
**4** sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced into thin rounds (the rounds should be thin enough to bend easily)
  *   
**5** eggs, beaten
  *   
**2** cups fresh spinach
  *   
**3** bacon slices, cooked and crumbled
  *   
**1** onion, sliced
  *   
**1** garlic clove minced
  *   
**2** tbsp. fresh chives
  *   
**2** tsp. olive oil
  * Cooking fat
  * Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

###  Directions

Preheat oven to 400 F.

Arrange potato slices in a pie dish in a circular pattern to form a “crust”
for the quiche.

Drizzle sweet potatoes with olive oil and season to taste.

Place in the oven and bake 15 to 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt some cooking fat in a skillet over medium heat and add the
garlic and onion.

Cook until the onion and garlic are soft and fragrant, around 5 minutes.

Add in the spinach. Sauté until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes, and set aside to cool
down.

When the sweet potatoes are done, lower the oven heat to 375 F.

In a bowl, combine beaten eggs with the spinach mixture, bacon, and chives.

Pour over the sweet potato crust, and place in the oven.

Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until the eggs are set; serve warm.
