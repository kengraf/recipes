###  Ingredients

  *  **1/2** cup hazelnuts
  * 1 cup Israeli couscous (aka pearl couscous; look for gluten-free if desired)
  * **1/4** teaspoon garlic powder
  * **3/4** teaspoon kosher salt, divided
  * 1 large garlic clove, minced
  * 1 shallot, minced
  * 1 pint cherry tomatoes, sliced
  * **1/4** cup chopped fresh dill
  * 3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
  * 2 cups baby arugula (or other baby greens)
  * **1/2** cup feta cheese crumbles (omit for vegan and add more salt to taste)
  * 2 tablespoons lemon juice, plus zest of ½ lemon
  * 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon olive oil
  * Fresh ground black pepper


###  Directions

1. Bring 1 ½ cups water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add the Israeli couscous, garlic powder and ½ teaspoon of the kosher salt and reduce to a simmer. Cover with lid and cook 8 to 10 minutes, until the couscous is tender and the water is absorbed.  Remove the couscous to a bowl, mix it with 1 teaspoon of the olive oil, and allow to stand for 2 to 3 minutes.   
2. Meanwhile, mince the garlic and shallot. Slice the cherry tomatoes in half. Chop the dill and mint.  
3. When the couscous is done resting, place it in a large bowl with the chopped vegetables and herbs. Add the baby arugula, feta cheese crumbles, lemon juice and zest, the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, ¼ teaspoon kosher salt, and a few grinds of black pepper. Mix gently to combine. Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 5 days (flavor is best right away but tastes great after refrigeration; you may need to revive the flavors with a pinch or two of salt).
