###  Ingredients

  * **1** Pound Dried Spaghetti
  *  **1** Cup Milk
  *  **1/2** Cup Heavy Cream
  *  **3** Large Eggs
  *  **2** Teaspoons Black Pepper
  *  **1** Teaspoon Salt
  *  **10** Ounces Grated Aged Pecorino Romano Cheese, Divided
  *  **6** Ounces Shredded Fontina Cheese
  *  **3/4** Cup Diced Pancetta, Cooked Until Golden Brown

###  Directions

Cook the pasta in a large pot of lightly salted water until it is “al dente”,
then drain well.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Butter a 9 inch casserole or springform pan.

In a large bowl, whisk together the milk, cream, eggs, pepper, salt, 8 ounces
of the Pecorino, the Fontina, and the pancetta.

Add the pasta, and stir until well mixed.

Pour the pasta mixture into your prepared pan.

Sprinkle the remaining Pecorino cheese on top, then bake until set, about 35
minutes.

Turn on the broiler, and brown the top of the pie for 2 to 3 minutes or until
golden brown.

Cool 10 to 15 minutes, then remove from pan, slice and serve.
