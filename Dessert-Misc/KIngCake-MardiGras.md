##  Ingredients

#### Dough
- 1 cup milk
- 1/4 cup salted butter
- 1 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2/3 cup warm water
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar divided
- 1 Tablespoon active dry yeast
- 2 large eggs beaten
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 5 to 5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour spooned & leveled
#### Cinnamon Filling
- 2/3 cup brown sugar
- 1/3 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 4 tablespoons salted butter melted
#### Frosting
- 2 cups powdered sugar
- 3 Tablespoons milk
- 1 Tablespoon salted butter melted
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

##  Directions

- Add the instant yeast to your mixing bowl with 3 cups of the flour and the sugar. 
Stir together, then add the warm milk, water, melted butter, beaten eggs, vanilla, and salt, 
mixing with the paddle attachment until smooth. Then switch to the dough hook and add the remaining flour, 
proceeding as normal with the kneading until you have a soft, smooth dough. 
Let the dough rise for 1 hour in the fridge
- Combine the brown sugar, granulated sugar, flour, cinnamon and butter, mixing to combine. Set aside. 
- Once the dough has doubled in size, punch it down. Roll out the dough into a large rectangle on a lightly floured surface, 
roughly 10×16-inches. Use a pizza cutter to divide the dough in half lengthwise to create two long rectangles.
- Crumble the cinnamon filling evenly over the dough and roll up into two long cylinders, 
just like when making cinnamon rolls. Twist the two logs together into a rope braid, 
then transfer to the prepared baking sheet, shaping into an oval and pinching the ends together. 
Cover lightly with plastic wrap and let rise for 30-45 minutes until puffy.
- Preheat oven to 350°F while the king cake is rising. Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden brown and baked through. 
The cake should be done when it reaches 190° to 195°F on a digital thermometer inserted into the center of each loaf.
Remove from oven and cool completely before frosting.
- Beat the powdered sugar, milk, butter, lemon juice, and vanilla in a medium bowl until smooth. 
The frosting should be pourable but thick.
- Stick a plastic baby figurine into each cake, pushing it down in to hide it. 
Drizzle the frosting over both king cakes, spreading it with a spatula if needed for good coverage. 
Sprinkle with the purple, green, and gold sugar while the frosting is still wet before it has a chance to set.
- Slice and serve. Whoever gets the slice with the baby gets to be king or queen for the day!
