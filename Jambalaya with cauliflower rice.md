###  Directions

In a large bowl add your shrimp and then add 4tsp of the spice mixture. Toss
and place shrimp in fridge until ready to use. Set spice seasoning aside.

in a large saucepan (or large pot) over medium heat add your 2 tbsp of olive
oil.

Next add the onion, green pepper and celery. Cook for 5 minutes.

Mix in your cauliflower rice and continue to cook for an additional 5 minutes.

Add your diced tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, and vegetable stock. Mix
together.

Add 2 tsp of remaining spice mixture to pot (you'll be left with extra, feel
free to add more at the end after you've added shrimp and pork if need be. Or
place in a small container and store in pantry for later use).

Bring pot to a boil, add 2 or 3 bay leaves and frozen okra, and then simmer
for 20 minutes.

Once pot has simmered (flavors have come together) add your pork medallions
and shrimp.

Continue to simmer until pork and shrimp have cooked through about 8-10
minutes.

Garnish with parsley and serve warm with optional bread to soak up the juice.
