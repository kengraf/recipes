###  Directions

Bring large pot of water to boil for pasta. Toss shrimp with 1 - 2 tablespoons
of cajun seasoning and coat well. Heat a large skillet over medium high heat
and drizzle bottom of pan with olive oil. Add shrimp and cook for 2 minutes or
so until starting to curl. Flip shrimp over and cook another minute or two and
then remove to a plate and set aside.

Drizzle pan with a little more olive oil, add sausage and brown until nicely
caramelized, about 4 - 5 minutes. Remove to plate, set aside.

Add pasta to salted boiling water and cook until al dente, a minute less than
package instructions.

Lower heat to medium and add another good drizzle of olive oil to the pan, add
the onion, red bell pepper, thyme, smoked paprika, 1 tablespoon cajun
seasoning, brown sugar and a generous pinch of salt. Sauté until onion and
pepper have softened a bit, scraping up any browned bits that you can. Add the
garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Add crushed tomatoes, chicken broth and Worcestershire sauce and bring to a
simmer, stirring and scraping up any brown bits from bottom of pan, simmer a
couple minutes.

Add cream and stir to combine, bring to a simmer. Once simmering, add cooked
pasta and andouille sausage and stir to combine and heat through, 2 - 3
minutes. Add more chicken broth or cream if it seems dry or you'd like more
sauce (I added ¼ cup of each).

Salt and pepper to taste and then lastly, add blackened shrimp and combine, or
place shrimp on top of pasta. Sprinkle with some more freshly cracked black
pepper, grated Parmesan and chopped parsley. Enjoy!
