###  Ingredients

  *  
**3** pounds assorted root vegetables: carrots, parsnips, celeriac, potatoes, turnips, etc.
  *   
**¼** cup olive oil
  * Salt and black pepper
  * Chopped rosemary, thyme or parsley, plus more for garnish

###  Directions

Heat oven to 425 degrees. Peel vegetables (optional) and cut them into 1- to
2-inch chunks, put them in a baking pan and toss with the oil and a sprinkling
of salt and pepper.

Put the vegetables in the oven and roast without stirring for 20 minutes, then
check. If they look dry and are sticking to the pan, drizzle with more oil.
Continue roasting, stirring or turning the vegetables once, for another 20
minutes or so. Stir in the herbs, then return the pan to the oven for another
20 to 40 minutes, until crisp. Remove from the oven. Garnish with rosemary or
thyme.
