###  Ingredients

  *   **3** tablespoons honey
  *   **¾** teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste
  * Kosher salt
  *   **2** tablespoons all-purpose flour
  *   **1 ½** teaspoons ground turmeric
  *   **1** pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
  *   **1** tablespoon coconut or canola oil
  *   **12** ounces asparagus, trimmed and thinly sliced on an angle
  *   **1** teaspoon unseasoned rice vinegar
  *   **1** lime, cut into wedges (yes, not optional)

###  Directions

In a small bowl or measuring cup, stir together 1/4 cup water with the honey,
pepper and 1/2 teaspoon salt; set honey mixture aside.

In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, turmeric and 1 teaspoon salt. Add
the chicken and toss until coated.

In a medium (10-inch) nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high. Add the
chicken and cook until the turmeric is fragrant and the chicken is golden
brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add the asparagus, season with
salt, stir to combine and cook until crisp-tender, 1 to 2 minutes.

Add the honey mixture and cook, stirring, until the chicken is cooked through
and the sauce has thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.

Remove from heat and stir in the vinegar, if using. Season to taste with salt
and pepper. Serve with lime squeezed over top, if you like.
