###  Directions

Place goose in a large pot. Add water to cover and stir in the sea salt.
Refrigerate overnight.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

Remove goose from water and drain well. Remove all innards and trim excess fat
from the tail. Rub inside cavity with lemon juice. Place apple, potato, orange
and celery inside the body cavity. Truss the bird like a turkey.

Place the goose in the preheated 450 degree F oven. Reduce oven temperature to
350 degrees F. Cook 20 to 25 minutes per pound. Baste the goose every half
hour with the basting syrup.

Carve goose and serve with stuffing and Cumberland sauce.

Basting Syrup:

Mix all ingredients together in a small bowl.

Stuffing:

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Coarsely chop the chestnuts and put in a large bowl. Add the stuffing mix,
raisins, celery, apple, onion and salt and pepper. Toss to combine. Pour in
the chicken stock, butter and cream and mix until evenly moistened.

Transfer to a baking dish and bake until the top is browned and crisp, about 1
hour.

Cumberland Sauce:

In a saucepan, combine the stock, port, vinegar, shallots, peppercorns and
orange juice. Bring to a boil, cook until reduced by 2/3, about 25 minutes.
Strain and refrigerate. Serve cold over roast goose.
