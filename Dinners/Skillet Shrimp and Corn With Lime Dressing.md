**Prep** 30 minutes  
**Makes** 4

###  Ingredients

  *  **1** pound large shrimp (preferably tail-on), peeled and deveined
  *   **2** teaspoons ground coriander
  * Kosher salt and black pepper
  *   **¼** cup fresh lime juice, plus 2 teaspoons lime zest, and 4 lime wedges (from 3 limes)
  *   **2** tablespoons thinly sliced mint, plus a few mint leaves for garnish
  *   **1** teaspoon honey
  *   **1** garlic clove, finely minced
  *   **½** Fresno chile, finely minced, seeds and ribs removed if desired
  *   **6** tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
  *   **3** cups fresh corn kernels (from about 4 ears)

###  Directions

Pat the shrimp dry, then toss with the coriander and a sprinkle of salt and
pepper. Let sit while you prepare the dressing.

Make the dressing: In a medium bowl, combine the lime juice, lime zest, mint,
honey, garlic, chile, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 cup olive oil. Whisk
until well combined and emulsified.

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil,
then add the shrimp in an even layer. Cook the shrimp until pink and just
cooked through, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove the shrimp to a plate.

Reduce the heat to medium and add the corn to the pan. Season with salt and
pepper, and cook the corn without stirring until it begins to brown on one
side, about 2 minutes. Give the corn a stir and cook for another minute.

Add the shrimp back to the pan, along with 2 tablespoons of the dressing, and
stir to coat everything in the dressing and to rewarm the shrimp.

Transfer to a serving platter, drizzle with more dressing, and garnish with
more mint. Serve with lime wedges.
