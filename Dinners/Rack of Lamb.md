Herb-Crusted Rack of Lamb with Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes
Ingredients:
 1 rack of lamb (8 ribs)
 2 tbsp Dijon mustard
 2 tbsp fresh rosemary, chopped
 2 tbsp fresh thyme, chopped
 3 garlic cloves, minced
 1 cup breadcrumbs (preferably panko)
 Salt and pepper to taste
 2 tbsp olive oil
For the Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes:
 2 lbs Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and quartered
 1 head of garlic, roasted (cut top off, drizzle with olive oil, and roast at 400°F for 20 minutes)
 1/2 cup heavy cream
 4 tbsp butter
 Salt and pepper to taste
Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
2. In a small bowl, combine the rosemary, thyme, garlic, breadcrumbs, salt, and pepper. Add olive oil to form a mixture
that sticks together.
3. Season the rack of lamb with salt and pepper, then brush with Dijon mustard.
4. Press the breadcrumb mixture onto the lamb to coat evenly.
5. Sear the lamb in a hot skillet with olive oil over medium-high heat for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown.
6. Transfer the lamb to the oven and roast for about 15-20 minutes for medium-rare (or longer for desired doneness).
7. While the lamb roasts, boil the potatoes in salted water until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and return to the pot.
8. Squeeze the roasted garlic into the potatoes, then add butter and heavy cream. Mash until smooth, and season with
salt and pepper.
9. Remove the lamb from the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing between the ribs.
10. Serve the lamb with a side of the creamy mashed potatoes and enjoy!
