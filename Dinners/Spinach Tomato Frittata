## INGREDIENTS
- 8 Eggs
- ⅓ cup Whole Milk 
- 1 teaspoon Italian Seasoning
- ½ teaspoon Salt
- ½ teaspoon Black pepper
- ¼ ground Cayenne Pepper (optional)
- 1 Onion
- 3 Garlic Cloves
- 2 cups Spinach
- 1 cup Tomatoes
- 1 cup Cheese
- 1 tablespoon Olive Oil


## DIRECTIONS
- First, preheat oven to 350.
- Whisk the eggs until well combined. Mix in the milk and spices, and set aside.
- Next, heat the oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-low heat and saute the onion for 3-4 minutes, or until soft and translucent.
- Add the spinach, tomato, and garlic and cook for 2 minutes, or until the spinach wilts and you can smell the garlic!
- Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the vegetables and let sit until slightly melted. I grated some pecorino Romano cheese, but you could use parmesan or mozzarella too!
- Add the egg mixture and tilt the pan as needed to ensure that it is evenly distributed, covering all of the vegetables.
- Place into a 350 degree oven and cook for 20 minutes, or until it has set in the middle and the edges are golden brown. Broil for 1-2 minutes until browned on the top (optional). Remove carefully from the oven and let sit for at least 5 minutes before serving.
