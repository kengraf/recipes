## INGREDIENTS
- •	1 medium spaghetti squash
-	kosher salt and pepper
-	olive oil, for brushing
-	1 tablespoon unsalted butter
-	4 garlic cloves, minced
-	28 ounces fire-roasted diced tomatoes
-	½ teaspoon dried basil
-	½ teaspoon dried oregano
-	pinch of sugar
-	8 ounces burrata cheese or fresh mozzarella
-	parmesan cheese, for topping
-	crushed red pepper, for topping
-	fresh basil, for topping

## DIRECTIONS
-	Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil and spray with nonstick spray.
-	Slice the spaghetti squash in half lengthwise and scrape out the sides. Spray or brush the cut sides with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Place the squash cut-side down on a baking sheet. Roast for 25 minutes.
-	While the squash is roasting, heat the butter in oven-safe skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the diced tomatoes with the basil, oregano and a pinch of salt and pepper. I also like to add a pinch of sugar here too to balance out the acidity. Bring this mixture to a boil then reduce it to a simmer, stirring often. I like to mash some of diced tomato chunks down too. After about 10 minutes, turn off the heat.
-	When the squash is done, let it cool for a minute until you can touch it. Use a fork to scrape out all the strands. I scrape them out and place them in a bowl. Add the strands to the sauce in the skillet. I use kitchen tongs or a fork to nestle them into the sauce. I don’t mind if a few pieces stick out because they get nice and crunchy.
-	Top the mixture with the burrata or mozzarella. If using burrata, pull it apart. If mozzarella, slice it and lay it on top.
-	Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the cheese is melty and golden and the whole mixture is bubbling. Top with parmesan, crushed red pepper and fresh basil before serving. If the mixture seems a bit watery, toss it a few times before serving. The squash will release some water as it sits, but roasting beforehand helps with this a bit!
