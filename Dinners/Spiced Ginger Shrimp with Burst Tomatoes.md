###  Ingredients

  * About 1 1/2 teaspoons aromatic spice blend, such as garam masala, Baharat, five-spice, curry powder, or a mild chili powder blend (see Note), plus more to taste
  *   **1 ½** teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger
  *   **2** garlic cloves, minced or finely grated
  *   **3** scallions, thinly sliced, greens and whites separated
  *   **¾** teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
  *   **¼** teaspoon black pepper
  *   **1** pound extra-large shrimp, shelled and deveined
  *   **1** tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
  *   **¾** cup small (or halved large) cherry tomatoes, preferably yellow Sungold tomatoes
  *   **2** tablespoons unsalted butter
  * Fresh lime juice
  *   **½** cup fresh mint leaves, torn or roughly chopped

###  Directions

In a medium bowl, combine spice blend, ginger, garlic, scallion whites, 1/2
teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Add shrimp and toss well. Heat a large
skillet over high heat, then add the oil. Add the tomatoes and 1/4 teaspoon
salt. Cook until the whole tomatoes burst and the halved ones start to
wrinkle, about 2 minutes.

Add shrimp mixture and sauté for another 2 to 4 minutes, turning the shrimp,
until they are pink all over.

Gently stir in butter and cook for another minute, until the shrimp are cooked
through. Remove from heat and add a squeeze of fresh lime juice. Taste and add
more salt and spices, if needed. Garnish with mint and scallion greens and
serve immediately.
