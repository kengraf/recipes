## DIRECTIONS POTATOES:  30 mins to complete
- Peel the potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch dice.  
- Place in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil.
- Once boiling, uncover, decrease the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until tender and easily crushed with tongs, approximately 10 to 15 minutes.
- Microwave the half-and-half and butter until warmed through, about 35 seconds. 
- Drain the potatoes in a colander and then return to the saucepan.  
- Mash the potatoes and then add the half and half, butter, salt and pepper and continue to mash until smooth.
- Stir in the yolk until well combined.

## DIRECTIONS FILLING:  30 mins to complete
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
- Saute onion and carrots on medimum-high just until they begin to take on color, approximately 3 to 4 minutes.  
- Add the garlic and stir to combine. 
- Add the lamb, salt and pepper and cook until browned and cooked through, approximately 3 minutes. 
- Sprinkle the meat with the flour and toss to coat, continuing to cook for another minute. 
- Add the tomato paste, chicken broth, Worcestershire, rosemary, thyme, and stir to combine. 
- Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer slowly 10 to 12 minutes or until the sauce is thickened slightly.
- Add the corn and peas to the lamb mixture.

## Combine
- Spread meat filling evenly into an 11 by 7-inch glass baking dish.  
- Top with the mashed potatoes, starting around the edges to create a seal to prevent the mixture from bubbling up  
- Smooth with a rubber spatula. 
- Place on a parchment lined half sheet pan on the middle rack of the oven.  
- Bake for 25 minutes or just until the potatoes begin to brown.  
- Remove to a cooling rack for at least 15 minutes before serving.
