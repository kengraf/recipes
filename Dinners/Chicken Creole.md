### Ingredients
- 4 to 6 chicken breasts I use the frozen boneless, skinless ones cut into inch size pieces
- 1/4 cup oil
- 1 medium onion chopped
- 1 green pepper chopped
- 1 cup celery chopped
- 1 14.5 ounce can petite diced tomatoes, undrained
- 1 6 ounce can tomato paste
- 1 cup chicken broth

- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon each dried basil oregano, thyme, marjoram, and minced garlic

- 2 cups rice cooked according to package directions.

### Instructions
- Saute chicken pieces in the oil until no longer pink. DO NOT OVERCOOK TO BROWN. Remove and keep warm.  
- In the same skillet, saute the onion, green pepper and celery in the remaining oil until tender.  
- Stir in the tomatoes, broth, tomato paste and seasonings.
- Bring to a boil, reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5 minutes.  
- Return chicken to the pan; heat through.  
- Serve with rice. Makes about 8 servings.
### Notes
We like this dish served over the rice the first night. If I have any left over I put it in a baking dish, mix the rice with the chicken and sauce, sprinkle with shredded cheese and put in the oven until warm and the cheese is melted the next night. Serve with garlic bread and a salad for a meal.
