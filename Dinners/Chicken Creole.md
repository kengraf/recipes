### Notes
We like this dish served over the rice the first night. If I have any left over I put it in a baking dish, mix the rice with the chicken and sauce, sprinkle with shredded cheese and put in the oven until warm and the cheese is melted the next night. Serve with garlic bread and a salad for a meal.
