###  Ingredients

  *  **1** pound spinach, washed
  *   **1 ½** pounds ground chicken
  *   **2** teaspoons kosher salt
  *   **½** teaspoon black pepper
  *   **½** teaspoon lemon zest
  * Pinch of ground cayenne
  * Pinch of ground nutmeg
  *   **½** teaspoon crushed fennel seeds
  * Pinch of ground cinnamon
  *   **1** cup roughly chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems
  *   **1** serrano chile, with seeds, finely chopped
  *   **1** egg, beaten
  *   **1** cup soft fresh bread crumbs, from about 4 slices of crustless sandwich bread
  *   **½** cup heavy cream, half-and-half or milk
 
  * Lime or lemon wedges, for serving

###  Directions

Step 1

Blanch the spinach: Plunge leaves a handful at a time into a pot of boiling
water. Leave just long enough to wilt, about 30 seconds, then drain in a
colander and cool under running water. Remove and squeeze wilted leaves into a
ball. Using a large knife, roughly chop spinach on a cutting board — you
should have about 2 cups. Squeeze into a ball again to remove excess water.
(This may be done several hours or up to a day in advance and refrigerated.)

Step 2

In a large bowl, put chicken, salt, pepper, lemon zest, cayenne, nutmeg,
fennel seeds, cinnamon, spinach, cilantro, chile, egg, bread crumbs and cream.
Using your clean hands, knead everything together, mixing well. Leave to
absorb seasoning for 15 minutes or overnight.

Step 3

Test for seasoning: Take a small amount and flatten into a thin patty. Quickly
cook in a small skillet, about 1 minute per side. Taste, then adjust the
mixture’s seasoning if necessary.

Step 4

Using an ice cream scoop or spoon, form 24 rough balls and place on a baking
sheet. (The mixture will be soft.) Lightly sprinkle the balls with a very
small amount of flour.

Step 5

Bake at 400 for 30 minutes turning once
