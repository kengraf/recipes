  *   **2** tablespoons balsamic vinegar
  *   **1/2** cup red wine
  *   **1/2** cup chicken broth
 ####  Pork Dry Rub
  *   **1/4** cup brown sugar
  *   **1** tablespoon garlic powder
  *   **2** teaspoons onion powder
  *   **2** teaspoons coarse salt
  *   **1** teaspoon cinnamon
  *   **2** teaspoons dried thyme
  *   **1** teaspoon pepper
  * Thickener **1.5** tablespoons cornstarch

###  Directions

First, prepare your pork dry rub by mixing together all of the spices in a
small bowl. Set aside.

Then, prepare veggies. Quarter 6 russet potatoes, chop a white onion, dice 6
medium carrots into 4 pieces each, and roughly chop 4 cloves of garlic.

Place the veggie medley on the bottom of your crockpot.

Next, rub your pork shoulder roast with the dry rub. Make sure that every nook
and cranny is covered in rub.

Heat around 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large cast iron skillet over
medium/high heat. When olive oil is fragrant, sear pork shoulder for 2 minutes
on each side.

Then, transfer pork into your crock pot and place on top of the veggies. Make
sure you scrape the skillet to get all of the delicious bits of rub off of it
and add that to the crockpot, too.

Create herb bundle, by using bakers twine to tie together thyme and rosemary
and set that on top of the pork.

Next, in a large Pyrex, mix together balsamic vinegar, red wine, and chicken
broth.

Then, pour that on top of the pork roast.

Cover crockpot and turn to high. Let cook for around 6-8 hours (flipping pork
roast halfway through cook time, if you can, if you canâ€™t no worries!).

Remove meat and vegetables from the crockpot and discard the herb bundle.

Using two forks, pull the pork roast apart into chunks and set aside.

Place 1/2 cup of the liquid left in the crockpot into a microwave safe Pyrex.
Whisk in cornstarch.

Place cornstarch mixture into the microwave for 45 seconds (mixture should be
thick a gelatinous).

Remove from the microwave and whisk the cornstarch mixture into the existing
liquid in the crockpot until it thickens into a thin gravy.

Place pork and vegetables back into the crockpot and mix, coating everything
in gravy.

TIPS & NOTES

If you already have our homemade pork dry rub on hand, use around 1/2 cup of
rub for a 3 lb. piece of meat.
