###  Ingredients

  * Ingredients in this Recipe
  *  **1** can (15 oz.) red beans, drained and rinsed
  *  **1** cup canned tomatoes in puree
  *  **1** green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
  *  **1** large green onion, white and pale green parts only, chopped
  *  **1** tsp. dried oregano
  *  **1** tsp. dried thyme
  *  **4** cups vegetable broth
  *  **6** cups chopped kale leaves
  *  **8** fresh okra pods, cut into 1/2 inch pieces, or 1 cup frozen okra
  * Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
  * Steamed white rice for serving

###  Directions

Cook the vegetables

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan or Dutch oven, combine the kale, bell pepper,
green onion, tomatoes and broth. Add the bay leaves, oregano and thyme. Bring
to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and
simmer until the kale is tender, about 30 minutes.

Finish the gumbo

Add the beans and okra to the vegetables. Cover and cook until the okra is
just tender, about 15 minutes for fresh, 5 minutes for frozen. Season with
salt, pepper and hot-pepper sauce, if using. Divide the rice among deep bowls
and ladle the gumbo atop.
