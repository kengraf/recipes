  *  **1/4** teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
  *  **1/4** teaspoon kosher salt

  *  **Ginger-soy glaze:**
  *  **1/4** cup honey

  *  **3** large garlic cloves, crushed
  *  **1 2** x1" piece of ginger, peeled, sliced
  *  **Wings: 5** pounds chicken wings, tips removed, drumettes and flats separated

  *   **1** tablespoon kosher salt
  *   **1/2** teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

###  Directions

For buffalo sauce:

Mix first 4 ingredients in a medium bowl; let stand for 5 minutes. Whisk in
hot sauce; keep warm.

DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead. Let cool completely; cover and chill.
Rewarm before using.

For ginger-soy glaze:

Bring all ingredients and 1/4 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan,
stirring to dissolve honey. Reduce heat to low; simmer, stirring occasionally,
until reduced to 1/4 cup, 7–8 minutes. Strain into a medium bowl. Let sit for
15 minutes to thicken slightly.

DO AHEAD: Can be made 5 days ahead. Cover; chill. Rewarm before using.

For wings:

Preheat oven to 400°F. Set a wire rack inside each of 2 large rimmed baking
sheets. Place all ingredients in a large bowl; toss to coat. Divide wings
between prepared racks and spread out in a single layer.

Bake wings until cooked through and skin is crispy, 45–50 minutes.

Line another rimmed baking sheet with foil; top with a wire rack. Add half of
wings to ginger-soy glaze and toss to evenly coat. Place wings in a single
layer on prepared rack and bake until glaze is glossy and lightly caramelized,
8–10 minutes.

Toss remaining half of wings in Buffalo sauce. Serve immediately (no need to
bake).
