###  Ingredients

  * **1** tablespoon olive oil
  *  **½** cup chopped onion
  *  **1** teaspoon minced garlic
  *  **4** cups chopped seeded tomatoes
  *  **1** tablespoon tomato paste
  * Coarse or kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
  *  **2** cups water
  *  **1** cup long grain rice
  *  **1** cup sliced scallions both white and green parts

###  Directions

Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium high heat. Saute the onions for
5 minutes until tender is lightly golden. Add the garlic and sauté for one
more minute until you can smell it. Add the tomatoes and tomato paste, season
with salt and pepper, and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally for
about 10 minutes until the tomatoes have cooked down.

Add the water, raise the heat to medium high, and let the mixture come to a
boil. Stir in the rice, cover, and bring to a simmer. Adjust the heat so that
it stays at a gentle simmer and cook for about 16 minutes, stirring once after
about 10 minutes, until the rice is cooked, and the liquid is mostly absorbed.
Stir in the scallions. Serve hot.
