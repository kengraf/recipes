###  Ingredients

  * **2** -pound first-cut brisket
  

  *  **4** large white onions
  

  *  **1** teaspoon olive oil
  

  * Paprika, salt and pepper to taste

###  Directions

1\. Loosely dice the onions and set them aside in a big bowl.

2\. Pat the brisket dry and pour a very generous amount of salt, pepper and
paprika on the less fatty side. Pour oil into a high-sided pan with a lid to
coat the bottom. Turn the stove to medium-high and place the fattier side down
in the pan for 7 minutes. When the meat is browned, flip it so the spiced side
is down and generously sprinkle more salt, pepper and paprika onto the fatty
side. Let cook uncovered for 4 more minutes.

3\. Pour in the entire bowl of onions; they should cover the meat and reach up
to the top of the pan. Cover with lid and turn down to a simmer.

4\. Cook for 3 to 4 hours, or until tender.

5\. Slice and serve brisket immediately; it’s great with rice.
