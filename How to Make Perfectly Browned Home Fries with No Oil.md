###  Ingredients

  * **3-4** medium sized Potatoes
  *  **1/2** Bell pepper diced
  *  **1/2** onion diced
  *  **3-4** cloves of garlic minced
  * A sprig of fresh rosemary coarsely chopped
  * Salt
  * Pepper
  * A shake or two of Turmeric
  * A shake or two of Chili powder

###  Directions

First you will dice your potatoes about a 1/2 inch thick.

Put them in the non-stick pan and just about cover them with water but not
quite all the way.

Cook on medium heat until boiling. Cover and lower heat cooking for about 6-7
minutes or until just under done. Usually this means that they are at least
3/4 of the way opaque but still hang into a fork when you pick one up.

Drain and set aside.

Add onions and peppers to hot pan and add the lid. Let them start to brown
without stirring for about a minute at high heat. The lid traps moisture and
this helps with sticking.

After about a minute start to stir. When you don't use oil you need to develop
a deliberate scrapping and turning method. Cook with some confidence here. It
will really help. If you just kind of push things around gingerly they may
stick and you don't want that. After about 3 minutes of browsing the onions
and peppers add the partially cooked potatoes along worn the garlic, rosemary,
and spices.

Stir until well combined then let sit I disturbed for about 4 minutes on low
heat.

After 3 minutes deliberately and somewhat carefully start to turn the potatoes
as evenly as you can. Once they are turned let them brown for bother 3 minutes
undisturbed. The trick for the browning is that you can't constantly stir
them. They need to stay in contact with the pan to develop some color and for
the sugars in the potatoes to caramelize from the heat.

Repeat this until the potatoes are as browned as you like them. If they are
drying out to much and are starting to stick keep the lid on.

Taste them. If they are not fully cooked lower the heat and add the lid for a
few minutes.

Serve as you like them. For me that mans hot sauce and ketchup or some really
good fresh salsa. :)
