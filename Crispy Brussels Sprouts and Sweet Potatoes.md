###  Ingredients

  * **1** pound Brussels sprouts
  *  **1** sweet potato (about 8 ounces)
  *  **2** cloves garlic, chopped
  *  **2** tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
  *  **½** teaspoon kosher salt
  *  **¼** teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
  *  **¼** teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

###  Directions

​Heat the oven (with the oven rack in the middle) to 425°F.

Trim the ends from the Brussels sprouts and discard. Peel the leaves apart and
add them to a rimmed sheet pan. Keep trimming the stem as you go to release
the leaves. Once you reach the heart of the sprout and can no longer separate
the leaves, cut it in half and add to the pan.

Dice the sweet potato: first slice it into about ¼-inch thick rounds. Stacking
2 rounds at a time, cut into ¼-inch sticks, then change directions and cut
them into ¼ inch squares. Add to the pan.

Chop the garlic and add to the pan. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with salt,
red pepper flakes, and black pepper. Toss to coat evenly then spread into a
single layer. Roast until the Brussels sprouts are crisp and the sweet potato
is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
