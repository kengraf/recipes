###  Ingredients

  * **2** cups red lentils
  *  **1** large onion, diced
  *  **1** tablespoon vegetable oil
  *  **2** tablespoons curry paste
  *  **1** tablespoon curry powder
  *  **1** teaspoon ground turmeric
  *  **1** teaspoon ground cumin
  *  **1** teaspoon chili powder
  *  **1** teaspoon salt
  *  **1** teaspoon white sugar
  *  **1** teaspoon minced garlic
  *  **1** teaspoon minced fresh ginger
  *  **1** (14.25 ounce) can tomato puree

###  Directions

Wash the lentils in cold water until the water runs clear. Put lentils in a
pot with enough water to cover; bring to a boil, place a cover on the pot,
reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, adding water during cooking as needed
to keep covered, until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain.

Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions
in hot oil until caramelized, about 20 minutes.

Mix curry paste, curry powder, turmeric, cumin, chili powder, salt, sugar,
garlic, and ginger together in a large bowl; stir into the onions. Increase
heat to high and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.

Stir in the tomato puree, remove from heat and stir into the lentils.
