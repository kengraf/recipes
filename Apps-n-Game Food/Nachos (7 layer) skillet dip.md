  * 1 large onion, finely chopped
  * 6 garlic cloves, finely chopped
  * 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
  * 3 canned chipotle chiles in adobo, finely chopped
  * 2 cans (15 ounces each) pinto beans, rinsed
  * 1 tablespoon kosher salt
  * 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

* Queso and assembly
  * 2 teaspoons adobo (from a can of chipotle chiles in adobo)
  * 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
  * 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
  * 1/2 cup water
  * 4 ounces yellow American cheese, grated or torn
  * 3 ounces Monterey Jack or pepper Jack cheese, grated
  * 2 ripe avocados, cut into 1/4‑inch pieces
  * 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
  * 1/4 cup sour cream
  * 1/2 cup salsa, drained if watery
  * 1/4 cup sliced pickled jalapeños
  * 4 scallions, green parts only, thinly sliced
  * 1/4 cup chopped cilantro

### Directions
1. Melt the butter in a medium deep skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, until tender and translucent, 8-12 minutes.

2. Increase heat to medium‑high and continue cooking, stirring often, until the onion is pale golden brown, 5-8 minutes more.
3. Reduce heat to medium; add the garlic and ground cumin. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

4. Add the chipotle chiles, pinto beans and salt. Pour in 1 cup water and bring to a simmer. Mash the beans until mostly smooth and cook until thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir in the apple cider vinegar.

5. In a small saucepan, whisk the adobo, ground cumin, salt and water; bring to a simmer. Add the yellow American cheese and whisk until smooth. Remove from heat and add the Monterey Jack, whisking until melted.
6. In a bowl, gently toss the avocados with the lime juice and a pinch of salt.

7. Pour the queso over the warm beans. Top with sour cream, salsa, avocados, pickled jalapeños, scallions, and cilantro.

8. Serve warm with tortilla chips and lime wedges.
