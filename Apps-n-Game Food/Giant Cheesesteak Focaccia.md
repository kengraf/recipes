**Cook**  Total time: 1 hour  
**Makes** 12

###  Ingredients

* Spicy aioli
  * 2 garlic cloves, finely grated
  * 1 cup mayonnaise
  * 1/4 cup chopped oil‑packed Calabrian chiles
  * 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
  * 1 teaspoon sugar
* Steak
  * 2 pounds thinly sliced boneless rib‑eye or skirt steak
  * 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground pepper
  * 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 
* Vegetables
  * 3 tablespoons vegetable oil (plus more as needed)
  * 1 large onion, thinly sliced
  * 1 large green bell pepper, sliced
  * 1 large red bell pepper, sliced
  * Pinch of kosher salt

* 12 ounces white American cheese, torn into pieces
* 13-by-9‑inch focaccia, store‑bought or homemade

### Directions
1. Mix the garlic, mayonnaise, Calabrian chiles, white wine vinegar and sugar in a medium bowl; set spicy aioli aside.

2. Arrange the sliced steak in a flat layer on a board or tray; season evenly with pepper and salt.

3. Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the onion, green pepper, red pepper and a pinch of salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and charred in spots, 8-10 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
4. Heat remaining vegetable oil in the same pan. Add half the seasoned steak, pressing it into an even layer. Cook undisturbed until browned underneath, about 2 minutes, then stir and cook until no raw pieces remain. Transfer to a plate; repeat with remaining steak, adding more oil if needed.

5. Return all cooked steak to the pan. Top with the white American cheese, cover, and let sit 5-10 minutes to melt. If cheese doesn’t melt fully, warm on low heat briefly.

6. Slice the focaccia horizontally. Spread the spicy aioli on the bottom half. Mix the meat and cheese to distribute, then arrange over the bread. Top with the cooked onions and peppers, then close the sandwich. Slice to serve.
