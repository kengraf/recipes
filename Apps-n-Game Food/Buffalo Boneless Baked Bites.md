###  Ingredients

  * 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs (about 1–1.5 lbs)
  * 2 tablespoons olive oil
  * 2/3 cup hot sauce, such as Frank’s, divided
  * 1 teaspoon garlic powder
  * 1 teaspoon onion powder
  * 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground
  * extra salt, in needed (see recipe notes)
 
### INSTRUCTIONS
* Trim chicken thighs so most of the visible fat is removed.
* Place 1/3 hot sauce, olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder in a medium bowl and mix together. Add the chicken and stir to coat. Cover and let the chicken marinade for at least 1 hour in the fridge.
* To bake in the oven, preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit, place the marinaded meat onto a baking tray in one layer and bake for about 25 minutes or until a meat temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit. If you like crispier chicken, broil for 1-3 minutes at the end.
* To air fry, preheat your air fryer to 380 degrees for a couple minutes. Spray the air fryer basket with a non-stick spray and place the chicken thighs inside in one layer. Air fry 10 minutes, then flip and air fry for 8-10 more minutes.
* Place the hot cooked chicken in a bowl and pour the remaining 1/3 cup hot sauce on top. Toss to coat and serve immediately.
