**Cook**  Total time: 1 hour, 15 minutes  
**Makes** 8

###  Ingredients

* For the salmon
  * 4‑pound skin‑on center‑cut salmon fillet
  * Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  * Kosher salt

* Tarragon crème fraîche
  * 1/2 medium shallot, finely chopped
  * 2 cups crème fraîche
  * 2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon
  * 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
  * Kosher salt (to taste)

* Spice mix for smoking
* 3 tablespoons coriander seeds
* 1 tablespoon black peppercorns
* 1 tablespoon dill seeds
* 1 teaspoon celery seeds

* For serving
  * Bagels, capers, sliced avocados, sliced cucumbers, watercress, and sliced scallions



### Directions
1. Pat the salmon dry. Coat the skin and wire rack generously with nonstick spray. Place salmon skin‑side down on the rack and set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Season the flesh side generously with salt. Chill uncovered for 3 hours.

2. In a bowl, whisk together the shallot, crème fraîche, tarragon and lemon zest. Taste and season with salt as needed. Cover and chill.

3. Crumple 2 large sheets of heavy‑duty foil into two 4‑inch balls. Heat the skillet over medium‑high for 6 minutes. Spread the wood chips in the center and cook until charred and smoking, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle coriander seeds, peppercorns, dill seeds and celery seeds over the chips.

4. Carefully place the rack with salmon into the skillet over the chips. Position the foil balls on either side of the salmon and push the skewers vertically into the fillet along the bloodline to support a loose foil cover. Tent loosely with foil, leaving space for smoke circulation.

5. Reduce heat to medium and smoke the salmon for 8 minutes. Reduce heat to the lowest setting and cook until an instant‑read thermometer inserted in the thickest part reads 120 F, 10-15 minutes. Transfer the rack back to the baking sheet and let cool 30 minutes.

6. Serve salmon at room temperature with the tarragon crème fraîche, bagels, capers, avocados, cucumbers, watercress, and scallions.
