#  Buttered  Cabbage

###  Ingredients

- 1 head of green cabbage
- 1 litre (4.25 cups) of chicken or vegetable stock
- pinch of sea salt
- 2 tablespoons of salted butter
- salt and black pepper to taste

### Instructions 

- Prep cabbage:  Remove any outer brown leaves of the cabbage and discard. Cut cabbage into 4 (quarters), remove stem and center parts and roughly chop.  Add to a sieve in batches and rinse with cold water.
- Add the stock to a large saucepan and place in the cabbage, ensuring it is submerged (don't worry if some pieces are just above the stock).
- Bring to a boil, then reduce heat cover and simmer for approx 15-20 minutes, cabbage should be nice and tender.
- Drain, add the cabbage back to the pan and place on a low heat just to cook off any excess liquid.
- Add in the butter and toss so it's all melted and coats the cabbage.
- Season with salt and black pepper.
