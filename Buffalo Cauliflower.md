###  Ingredients

  *  1 head cauliflower - chopped into florets
  * 1 teaspoon salt
  * 1 teaspoon garlic powder
  * ½ teaspoon onion powder
  * 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
  * ¼ teaspoon black pepper
  * ¾ cup milk
  
#### for the buffalo sauce
* ½ cup buffalo wing sauce
* 3 tablespoons salted butter - add 1/8 teaspoon salt if using unsalted butter
* 2 tablespoons honey
* ranch or blue cheese dressing for serving

###  Directions

Preheat oven to 450 degrees and grease a baking sheet.  
Stir together salt, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, and black pepper. Stir in milk.  
Dip cauliflower in the milk mixture, turning to coat completely, shake off excess and arrange in a single layer on prepared baking sheet.  
Bake for 10 minutes, use a fork to turn over cauliflower pieces, and bake another 10 minutes.  
While cauliflower is baking, combine buffalo wing sauce, butter, and honey in a medium sauce pan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, cook 2-3 minutes, then remove from heat.  
Brush buffalo sauce all over the baked cauliflower, bake another 10 minutes (I like to broil it for the last 2-3 minutes).  
Serve fresh with ranch or blue cheese dressing for dipping.

### Notes
Serves two as a main dish, 6-8 as an appetizer.
